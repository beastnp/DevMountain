                    <h1>How crazy</h1>
                    <p>Saturday night at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, a dubious streak will come to an end for either the Utah Utes or the Arizona State Sun Devils when one team will do something it's never done before.</p>
                    <p>For Utah to remain the league's only undefeated team and atop the Pac-12 South Division standings, it's going to have to beat Arizona State for the first time since joining the conference in 2011.</p>
                    <p>For Arizona State to regain a foothold on the division and continue its ascension from what could have been a disastrous season, it's going to have to beat a top 10 team on the road for the second time in one season -- something that hasn't happened since folks in Tempe thought it was a good idea to start playing organized football.</p>
                    <p>The tasks facing each are equally daunting, and equally critical. Utah, fresh off a 30-24 home win over No. 23 Cal, is enjoying its best start since jumping out to 8-0 in 2010. And the Utes' 5-0 start is the strongest since it joined the league.</p>

                        <p>Arizona State opened the season with a loss to Texas A&M and followed it up with two lackluster wins and some flat-out bad football in a loss to USC. Since, the Sun Devils have played inspired football with victories over UCLA and Colorado and an argument can be made they are the hottest team in the conference the last two weeks.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, ASU has picked things up drastically on the defensive side of the ball. Over the last two games, the Sun Devils have yielded just 111 yards on the ground while turning three turnovers into 20 points. They are coming off of an eight-sack performance against Colorado.</p>
