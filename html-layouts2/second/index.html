               <p>This year, the NHL had 18 teams in the top half of all franchises, more than any other league. That's thanks in large part to high scores in categories like bang for the buck and player likability, almost across the board. Of course, the bad -- well, it's really bad. Moral of the story? It's good to be a hockey fan -- as long as you're not in Toronto. </p>

                <p>Three Stanley Cups in six years have been good for the hearts and minds of Chicago Blackhawks fans but not for their wallets. While the Blackhawks rank near the top in every category related to on-ice performance, the franchise dropped outside the overall top 10 this year because of rising costs to attend games at the United Center.</p>
